                                   we took a comprehensive approach, including an exhaustive listening exercise (Surveys, FGDs, Workshops,

                                   designed to serve Marico in the long-run.</p>
                              <p className='py-4'>Our strong belief in ‘Values create Values’ have empowered us to evolve, innovate and excel. As we progress, we
                                   realise the importance of staying ahead of the curve with differentiated and innovative offerings. The ‘Marico Way’ is

                                   only designed to drive Marico closer to its ambitious goals, but also to create an inclusive, socially responsible and
                                   forward-thinking company culture. Hence, as part of the design, we also looked through various lens encompassing
                                   a new generation workforce, rapid technology adoption and the aspirations of Marico 3.0. With ‘the Marico Way’,

                         At Marico, prioritising the occupational health and safety of our workforce is not just a mandate but an ingrained aspect of our daily operations. This commitment to safety permeates every function within the organisation. Adopting this mindset, we have effectively instilled behavioural shifts aimed at eradicating unsafe practices and promoting proactive measures. Our pervasive safety culture, practised across our organisational footprint, serves as a shield against injuries, bolstering morale and enhancing overall employee health. Consequently, this not only improves efficiency and productivity, but also fosters a safer and more productive work environment for all.

                         SHE Governance Mechanism
                    </p>
                    <p className='mb-3'>
                         Health and safety at our manufacturing facilities is managed by Safety Health and Environment (SHE) Management Committee. The committee is headed by Works Head and includes departmental heads.
                    </p>
                    <p className='mb-3'>
                         Health and safety officers are responsible for driving SHE related activities at the factories and directly report to respective Works Heads about SHE performance. SHE performance of facilities is reviewed by the committee and corporate team
                         on monthly basis to analyse the risks and take appropriate action to improve performance.
                    </p>
                    <p className='mb-3'>
                         Concerted efforts are put to investigate each incident and derive meaningful insights to deploy the corrective and preventive actions across all our sites to prevent a similar mishap in future.

                                   Health and safety at our manufacturing facilities is managed by Safety Health and Ensuring the safety of our employees and subcontractors is our foremost priority across all our locations. Our SHE Management System operates on the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) model. The comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) policy serves as the primary driver and is communicated to all relevant stakeholders through various channels. Additionally, each site is governed by a standardised framework established by our technically sound SHE team to ensure consistent outcomes. To address occupational safety related concerns, a systematic framework comprising policies, capacity building and governance has been implemented. We have established procedures to assess the risks associated with physical, chemical, and fire hazards. A structured incident reporting and investigation process has enabled us to minimise major incidents.

                                   We evaluate the effectiveness of our systems through rigorous internal
                                   and external audit procedures. Our leadership team conducts monthly review meetings to track the status of key SHE (Safety, Health, and Environment) KPIs. Additionally, all our sites have been ISO 140012015 and 450012018 certified for several years. These audits have facilitated the adoption of industry best practices.
