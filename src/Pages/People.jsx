                        ‘The Marico Way’ embodies the foundation of a journey towards building the Marico of tomorrow. With a refreshed
                        set of values, we are charting a roadmap for the organisation’s future, focused on challenging the status quo,
                        adapting to change and evolving in a dynamic business environment. At Marico, we took a conscious decision to
                        build a Company grounded in ‘Values’ that resonate with our customers, partners and communities.</p>
                      <p className='py-4'>As we gear up for ‘Marico 3.0’, the next phase of our growth journey, we strive to remain closely aligned with the

                        we took a comprehensive approach, including an exhaustive listening exercise (Surveys, FGDs, Workshops,
                        Stakeholder Interviews etc) with our members and business partners/stakeholders across business units and
                        geographies. ‘The Marico way’ lay the groundwork for a future-focused organisation that is ready to imbibe the next
                        generation way of working. It serves as a gateway for understanding and aligning the company culture with the needs
                        of a new-age workforce. Our revamped values will also encourage a culture of digital experimentation and adoption,
                        designed to serve Marico in the long-run.</p>
                        <p className='py-4'>Our strong belief in ‘Values create Values’ have empowered us to evolve, innovate and excel. As we progress, we
                        realise the importance of staying ahead of the curve with differentiated and innovative offerings. The ‘Marico Way’ is
                        the result of a carefully crafted blend of our purpose, ethos and values that truly define our unique identity and carve
                        the path for the ‘Marico of Tomorrow’.</p>
                        <p className='py-4'>Our values have been the guiding light, strengthening our ability to adapt and evolve. The revamped values were not
                          only designed to drive Marico closer to its ambitious goals, but also to create an inclusive, socially responsible and
                          forward-thinking company culture. Hence, as part of the design, we also looked through various lens encompassing
                          a new generation workforce, rapid technology adoption and the aspirations of Marico 3.0. With ‘the Marico Way’,
                          we are confident of building a courageous, bold, agile and consumer-centric Marico – committed to the purpose of
