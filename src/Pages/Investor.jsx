                         sluggishness in mass consumption sentiment in India and macro
                         headwinds in key overseas markets. In this context, we deployed
                         our resources judiciously to stay resilient in our core businesses and
                         catalyse diversification and premiumization, thereby putting in place
                         building blocks of sustainable profitable growth and strengthening
                         our business model. While we navigated the challenging demand
                         scenario, we adequately invested behind strategic initiatives and
                         delivered record profitability in an accommodative input cost
                         environment. We continued to direct the resources at our disposal to
                         build top-quartile capabilities and a stronger platform for consistent
                         growth in the medium and long term.</p>

                              retail inflation during the year, the FMCG
                              sector witnessed slower-than-anticipated
                              recovery in demand sentiment with
                              some green shoots in rural consumption
                              emerging towards the end of the year. In
                              line with the strategic intent to strengthen
                              the long-term equity of the core portfolios
                              and drive differential growth in the new
                              franchises, investments towards brand
                              building remained a key thrust area for
                              the Company. Advertising and Promotion
                              spend in FY24 were at 9.9% of sales, up
                              13% YoY. The Company complemented
                              its investments towards organic growth
                              by making investments in businesses that
                              are synergistic to its overall diversification
                              strategy. The strategic investment in
                              ‘Plix’, the digital-first nutraceuticals and
                              plant-based personal care brand, was
                              another step towards broadening the play
                              in chosen categories in India. We expect
                              focused investments towards organic
                              and inorganic growth to accelerate
                              the diversification journey of both the
                              domestic and international businesses
                              and build new levers of sustainable
                              growth.</p>
                         <p className='pg py-4'>During the year, the Company incurred
                              capital expenditure of ₹ 153 crores for
                              capacity expansion and maintenance of
                              existing manufacturing facilities. Cash
                              generated from operations, at ₹ 1,436
                              crores in FY24, remained the primary
                              source of liquidity for Marico. We
                              also continued to accrue savings from
                              the institutionalised cost management
                              initiatives across domestic and overseas
                              operations. These savings enabled us to
                              partially offset the unfavourable impact of
                              foreign exchange depreciation in some of
                              our overseas markets during the year.</p>
                         <p className='pg py-4'>We continued to assess potential risks

                              the organisation-wide risk management
                              programme. During the year, we
                              maintained profitable operations and
                              enjoyed a comfortable net cash surplus
                              . Net surplus at the end of the year
                              stood at ₹ 1,034 crores. While current
                              borrowings are mainly for working
                              capital requirements, we actively explore
                              opportunities to optimise borrowing costs
                              and maximise yield on investments, while
                              maintaining conservative guardrails
                              on safety, liquidity and returns.
                              While following a prudent cash flow
                              management, we ensure adequate access
                              to funding and leverage the surplus to
                              meet our operating needs and strategic objectives. Moreover, the strength of our
                              balance sheet and a favourable AAA
                              credit rating gives us the leverage to
                              overcome exigencies that could affect our
                              liquidity position in future. As on March
                              31, 2024, our Debt/EBITDA was minimal
                              at 0.19x.</p>
