                <p className='mt-4'>
                    Marico has implemented a Responsible Sourcing Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct which applies to all our suppliers, business associates, and subcontractors, including those involved in raw materials, packaging, logistics, warehousing, third- party manufacturing and services. We use a three-pronged maturity based approach, through SAMYUT  – our Responsible Sourcing programme, to engage with our value chain partners about our sustainability vision, emphasising our commitment to ethical, social and environmental standards through strong governance. <br /><br />
                    Our goal is to progressively increase our procurement spend on certified sustainable materials and local resources, while also improving diversity within our supplier base. A cross-functional team is dedicated to setting and achieving these targets. For more details, please read the ‘Transform value Chain Sustainably’ section in the Environment chapter of this report (Pg. No. 166).
