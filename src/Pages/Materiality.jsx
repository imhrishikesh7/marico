                                    <p className='pg py-4'>At Marico, we arrive at material ESG issues through a structured and comprehensive process that involves multiple
                                          steps. After the completion of our first 5-year sustainability plan (2017-2022), we launched our 2030 ESG Roadmap
                                          on the 50th anniversary of the World Environment Day, 05th June 2022. We have been gradually deepening the
                                          depth and coverage of our material ESG KPIs to cover all business-critical aspects since then. The journey began with
                                          extensive stakeholder engagement, where we identified and engaged relevant stakeholders, including Marico members,
                                          consumers shareholders, value chain partners, regulators, community members and other key stakeholders. Through
                                          surveys, interviews, focus groups and public consultations, we gained a deeper understanding of stakeholder concerns,
                                          expectations and priorities regarding ESG issues.</p>
                                    <p className='pg py-4'>Benchmarking and industry analysis play a critical role in this process. We regularly assess the ESG practices and
                                          disclosures of peer organisations and industry leaders to identify common material issues and best practices. We also
                                          refer to industry-specific guidelines and standards provided by organisations such as the Global Reporting Initiative
                                          (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). This comparative analysis helps us to understand our
                                          position in comparison to our peers.</p>
                                    <p className='pg py-4'>We regularly review current and upcoming regulations related to ESG in the regions where we operate, ensuring
                                          adherence to all legal requirements. This proactive approach helps in identifying critical issues that need to be addressed
                                          to avoid legal repercussions and align with government policies.</p>
                                    <p className='pg py-4'>Internally, thorough business impact and risk assessments are conducted to understand how various ESG issues
                                          affect relevant functions like operations, financial performance and strategic objectives. Our evaluation of risks and
                                          opportunities associated with each ESG issue, from both short-term and long-term perspectives, enables us to prioritise
                                          those that are most significant to our business and stakeholders.</p>

                                    <p className='pg py-4'>To ensure strategic alignment of risks and mitigation measures, we review and validate the identified material ESG issues
                                          at the highest levels. These issues are then integrated into our overall business strategy, policies and operational plans, to
                                          embed ESG considerations into our core operations.</p>
                                    <p className='pg py-4'>Reports, microsite and a plethora of stakeholder engagement platforms are used to continuously evaluate the
                                          performance and disclosure of material ESG matters. It drives transparency and accountability, thereby keeping our
                                          market reputation as a responsible player intact. This holistic approach not only ensures regulatory compliance but also
                                          builds resilience and drives long-term value creation for all stakeholders, thereby defining a sustainable future for the
                                          entire ecosystem.</p>

                              We aim to empower more than 1 lakh farmers with knowledge of sustainable farming practices and develop a Sustainable Coconut standard to provide recommendations for  offsetting the crop’s carbon footprint across its entire lifecycle. These measures are targeted towards improving productivity and enhancing climate resilience, as well as offsetting carbon impact through afforestation programmes, across coconut plantations. The programme aims to enrol more
                              than 4 lakh acres of coconut plantation by 2025 and achieve a cumulative productivity improvement rate of 16%.

By 2030, we plan to align the purpose, messaging and impact-driven actions of its top 5 brands with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). Each of these top 5 brands will annually quantify and disclose the sustainable impacts achieved year-on-year, in accordance with the relevant UN-SDGs, along with their targets and indicators.
