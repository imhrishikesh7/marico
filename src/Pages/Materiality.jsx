                Mitigating climate risks, optimising the use of natural resources, and protecting

                         Marico</p>
                         <p className='pg py-4'>At Marico, we arrive at material ESG issues through a structured and comprehensive process that involves multiple
                            steps. After the completion of our first 5-year sustainability plan (2017-2022), we launched our 2030 ESG Roadmap
                            on the 50th anniversary of the World Environment Day, 05th June 2022. We have been gradually deepening the
                            depth and coverage of our material ESG KPIs to cover all business-critical aspects since then. The journey began with
                            extensive stakeholder engagement, where we identified and engaged relevant stakeholders, including Marico members,
                            consumers shareholders, value chain partners, regulators, community members and other key stakeholders. Through
                            surveys, interviews, focus groups and public consultations, we gained a deeper understanding of stakeholder concerns,
                            expectations and priorities regarding ESG issues.</p>
                        <p className='pg py-4'>Benchmarking and industry analysis play a critical role in this process. We regularly assess the ESG practices and
                        disclosures of peer organisations and industry leaders to identify common material issues and best practices. We also
                        refer to industry-specific guidelines and standards provided by organisations such as the Global Reporting Initiative
                        (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). This comparative analysis helps us to understand our
                        position in comparison to our peers.</p>
                        <p className='pg py-4'>We regularly review current and upcoming regulations related to ESG in the regions where we operate, ensuring
                        adherence to all legal requirements. This proactive approach helps in identifying critical issues that need to be addressed
                        to avoid legal repercussions and align with government policies.</p>
                        <p className='pg py-4'>Internally, thorough business impact and risk assessments are conducted to understand how various ESG issues
                        affect relevant functions like operations, financial performance and strategic objectives. Our evaluation of risks and
                        opportunities associated with each ESG issue, from both short-term and long-term perspectives, enables us to prioritise
                        those that are most significant to our business and stakeholders.</p>
                        
                        <p className='pg py-4'>To ensure strategic alignment of risks and mitigation measures, we review and validate the identified material ESG issues
                        at the highest levels. These issues are then integrated into our overall business strategy, policies and operational plans, to
                        embed ESG considerations into our core operations.</p>
                        <p className='pg py-4'>Reports, microsite and a plethora of stakeholder engagement platforms are used to continuously evaluate the
                        performance and disclosure of material ESG matters. It drives transparency and accountability, thereby keeping our
                        market reputation as a responsible player intact. This holistic approach not only ensures regulatory compliance but also
                        builds resilience and drives long-term value creation for all stakeholders, thereby defining a sustainable future for the
                        entire ecosystem.</p>
