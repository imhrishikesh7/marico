            Marico’s Environmental Stewardship Journey
          </h3>

          <p className="normal-text-container">
            Since our inception, we considered environmental stewardship as a core value. Pioneering steps like transitioning to coalfree operations and implementing the first agro-fuel based boiler laid the foundation for further advancements. We have
            consistently sought the use of cleaner energy sources, culminating in the achievement of the first carbon-neutral plant
            certification and the installation of our first solar facility.
            <br />
            Building upon the Marico legacy of making a difference, we envision sustainable business-centric growth in the years to come.
            We strive to minimise our environmental footprint throughout the value chain, from sourcing to production and distribution.
            We are constantly innovating to improve energy efficiency and transition to renewable energy sources. By integrating
            environmental responsibility into every aspect of our operations, we are also committed to minimsing the environmental impact
            of our products and packaging and create a sustainable roadmap for building a healthier planet for generations to come

          <p className="normal-text-container mb-3">
            Our India business commits to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (in owned manufacturing facilities) by 93%, and offset
            remaining 7% emissions through sequestration, and carbon offset by 2030, from the baseline year FY13. We have categorised
            our manufacturing profile, based on our climate-action potential to ensure cross-functional capacity enhancement and successful
            completion of targets with no major business barriers caused in the process. To further drive our net zero agenda, a systematic GHG
            inventory is maintained to identify and quantify all direct and indirect (Scope 1, 2 and 3) emissions from our operations and value
            chain. With an aim to gradually imbibe each of our units into the transitional pathway of carbon neutrality, we strive to optimise its
            energy footprint and invest in low-carbon technology to minimise operational emissions. We are actively adopting renewable sources
            of energy to meet operational requirements and opt for local carbon sinks to enable carbon sequestration.
            <br />
            The robust action plan delineated in FY24 significantly contributes to achieving our ambitious net-zero target in India operations
            (owned manufacturing units). Moreover, this plan ensures the conservation of valuable non-renewable resources, while
            simultaneously safeguarding the company's business.

            We strive to optimise water usage across our manufacturing facilities.
            To fulfil our water stewardship goals, we continuously monitor water
            stress quotients in the areas adjacent to our manufacturing facilities and
            invest in water efficient systems in operations. We practice rainwater
            harvesting and rainwater usage for process cooling purposes and
            deploying zero liquid discharge (ZLD) principles to reduce freshwater
            consumption in our manufacturing units. With dedicated investments
            in water-saving technologies and optimisation of water consumption,
            we seek to reduce our overall water footprint and contribute to the
            sustainable use of this precious resource.

            <p className='normal-text-container mt-2 md:w-[60%]'>Marico’s Jalgaon unit manufactures refined
              edible oil. By nature, the process of oil
              refining is a water intensive operation.
              Reducing water consumption at this location
              was crucial, since 41% of the organisation’s
              water consumption was single-handedly
              attributed to this manufacturing facility.
              Over the last few years, the manufacturing
              teams took proactive measures to address
              this issue. To reduce the overall specific
              water consumption by brand Saffola
              (water consumption in KL per unit of
              oil processed in KL), we are optimising
              processes, installing new equipment and
              reusing recycled water. The key interventions
              included process optimisation to reduce
              resource consumption by design, through
              tech-enabled upgrades and reuse of treated
              waste water (from STP) in cooling towers
              and recovery of condensed steam and
              efficient recycling of water using advanced
              equipment. <br />
              The impact our water stewardship initiatives is multifaceted. On a corporate level, the implementation of water-efficient practices
              ensures operational resilience and resource optimisation. For local communities, our interventions contribute to improved water
              availability, agricultural productivity and overall community well-being. By aligning our business practices with responsible water
              stewardship, Marico not only mitigates environmental risks but also exemplifies corporate leadership in addressing the global
              challenge of water scarcity and sustainability. </p>

                At Marico’s Puducherry manufacturing unit, we follow a strict process to produce edible grade coconut
                oil. The raw material utilised in this process is the dried coconut kernel or copra. To ensure procurement of
                premium quality raw material, we source copra from certified vendors. Strict quality control measures are
                followed by the factory to ensure high-quality of the final product. Extracted coconut oil is then sent to our
                third-party associates for packaging and distribution to the market. <br />

                Of late, the Puducherry area has been affected by scarcity of freshwater, primarily on account of factors such
                as rapid urbanisation, inefficient water management and seasonal variation in rainfall. Our manufacturing
                facility evaluated either of the two viable options available to address the crisis: purchase wastewater from
                nearby firms and treat it for reuse or reduce the consumption of water. We decided to pursue the consumption
                reduction and resource optimisation strategy, in alignment with our strong emphasis on water stewardship
                principles.
                <br />

                The Y-o-Y absolute and specific water consumption at the Puducherry unit has undergone remarkable
                reduction (as shown in the following graph). <p className='text-[#296a1d] font-bold text-[22px] mt-2'> The initiatives undertaken in the past 5 years have reduced

              With the help of our EcoIndex framework, we identify,
              manage and mitigate impacts related to sustainability in every
              stage of the product life cycle, from sourcing, to designing,
              manufacturing, transportation, distribution and end-life
              disposal. The aim of this framework is to foresee the potential
              environmental and social impacts of our products and enables
              informed decision-making. Drawing reference from multiple
              international frameworks, research-based publications and
              ecolabel certifications, it measures the sustainability footprint
              of products. The framework also supports benchmarking the
              sustainability footprint of our products with renowned worldclass standards on product sustainability. With EcoIndex, we are
              institutionalising innovation within the organisation and across
              stakeholders.  <br />
              The year FY23-24 focused on collaboratively institutionalising
              the conceptual elements of product sustainability into a
              structured and consistent EcoIndex framework. All relevant
              functions including R&D, Procurement, Marketing, Compliance
              and Manufacturing Operations worked cohesively to consolidate
              the EcoIndex model and its modus operandi. Approximately
              50 products have been assessed using the EcoIndex lens to
              identify opportunities for improving the sustainability footprint
              of the products across environmental, social and governance
              aspects. Prototypes are also being developed to communicate
              and seek insights from our consumers on the value propositions
              of EcoIndex framework.
