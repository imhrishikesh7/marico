                headwinds and unpredictable climate conditions played a part in shaping the
                operating landscape in some of our key markets. Despite these challenges, we
                exhibited remarkable resilience. We closed the year on a promising note with
                improving trends across both the domestic and international businesses at our
                highest-ever annual operating margin. Offtakes across key domestic portfolios
                remained healthy with 75% of the business either gaining or sustaining market
                share and 100% of the business either gaining or sustaining penetration. The
                International business delivered strong growth on the back of a steady recovery
                in Bangladesh post transient headwinds and robust growth momentum in MENA

                                reaching ~20% in FY24, up from around 15% in FY23.
                                Moving forward, we will continue to aggressively diversify
                                the portfolio by scaling up our Foods and Premium Personal

                                current size by FY27. Similarly, we aim to achieve a 20+%
                                CAGR in the Premium Personal Care portfolio, within which
                                we expect to double the current annual recurring revenue
                                (ARR) of the Digital-first portfolio by FY27. Consequently,

                                strengthened and provided margin upside in the overall
                                business over the medium term. In Vietnam, the expansion
                                into female personal care has built new growth levers for
                                the business. The resultant geographical diversification from

                                business reflects in the reduction in the revenue and profit
                                dependence on the Bangladesh market. Furthermore, within
                                Bangladesh, the scale up of new franchises of Shampoos,
                                Skin Care and Baby Care has led to decreasing revenue

                                    each of the digital business subsidiaries run
                                    independently, we have put in place systems
                                    and processes to leverage synergies and
                                    mutual learnings across these platforms. We
                                    have been making consistent investments
                                    in new age technologies and platforms like

                                    RPA Bots, Virtual Assistants. Deployment
                                    of Digital technologies have enabled us
                                    to provide more granular and accurate
                                    forecasts, improve inventory management
                                    and ensure product traceability. Investments
                                    in AI/ML technologies have led to cost
                                    optimisation, improving decision-making
                                    and greater agility in responding to market
                                    dynamics and consumer demands. Our foray
                                    into Gen AI has helped improve consumer

                                    turnarounds and employee engagement.</p>

                           <p className='pg py-4'>Inclusion and Diversity is an integral
                                part of organization’s strategy.
                                Diversity fuels innovation and various
                                research indicate a strong correlation
                                of diversity with positive business
                                outcomes. As part of our Inclusion &
                                Diversity agenda, we have defined
                                three key pillars of Diversity – Gender,
                                Persons with Disability and Thought
                                Diversity. While most organizations
                                who adopt Diversity as an agenda
                                look to start at the bottom of the
                                pyramid, we have taken the tougher
                                route and focused on first enhancing
                                diversity at the top. We are also
                                prioritizing localization of talent
                                across our country business units.
                                We believe that building a positive,
                                enabling and truly inclusive Culture is
                                pivotal for success in our journey of
                                enhancing Diversity and building a
                                future forward organization. For us,
                                Inclusion is the process, Diversity is the
                                outcome. Hence, we are focusing on
                                building an inclusive culture through
                                members sensitization and education.
                                While we enable accessibility of
                                infrastructure, policies, and processes
                                for diverse groups, we continue to
                                monitor the members experiences and
                                foster an environment where members
                                can bring their own self and be at
