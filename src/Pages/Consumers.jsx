                                   campaign aimed to educate the Indian
                                   consumer about this difference. Through
                                   our ‘Real Rolled Oats’ campaign, we
                                   encouraged people to take the ‘Dust
                                   Test’, a simple kitchen experiment, where
                                   they sift their oats through a kitchen
                                   sieve. When the True Elements Rolled
                                   Oats is sieved, the dust-free grains are
                                   left behind without a trace of dust seen
                                   in other brands, thereby reiterating its
                                   promise of delivering nutritious and
                                   dietary fibre-rich rolled oats. 'The Oats
                                   Dust Test' is now a key intervention to

                              <p className='pg py-2'>For ‘Just For Baby’ clinic activation, we partnered with Childline, a well-known Non-profit Organisation, which deals with children's
                                   rights and protecting children in South Africa. The collaboration with Childline offered ‘Just For Baby’ a wide reach of over 100 medical
                                   clinics in the KwaZulu-Natal region across FY 2024. With the Just For Baby Clinic activation, the brand visited local government clinics
                                   where mothers take their babies for regular check-ups.</p>
                              <p className='pg py-2'>During the scheduled appointment at the clinic, mothers are expected to wait for their turn to visit the doctor. The brand utilized this time
                                   to engage with mothers as well as expectant parents. Along with educating them about proper ways of taking care of children’s health
                                   and well-being, parenting tips and guidance was also provided. Through this campaign, the parents were informed about the benefits
                                   of the products, while giving product samples and information leaflets. The brand also hosted fun Q&A sessions and winners were
                                   awarded ‘Just for Baby’ products. The campaign continues to create brand relevance and engagement, encouraging more mothers to
                                   rely on the ‘Just For Baby’ skincare range for their children.</p>
